Title

Flowdex — Add Top Nav + “How it Works” page, keep Library & Builder pages, apply code rules

Prompt

We already have two screens: the main library (builders grid) and the builder profile (workflow by phases). Enhance the product with:

1) Global Top Navigation (on all pages)

Brand at left: Flowdex (click → /).

Right-side links:

Builders (goes to / – the library page)

How it Works (new page at /how-it-works)

Create Profile (opens existing dialog / stub you already made)

Keep it minimal, clean, and sticky on scroll. Mobile = collapsible menu.

2) Library (keep existing page, just polish)

Keep the current grid of builder cards.

Hero:

Title: AI Builder Showcase

Subtitle: Real workflows from builders using AI tools. See how they actually work, phase by phase.

CTA: Create Profile button (existing stub ok)

Ensure cards look consistent with the builder page styling.

3) Builder Profile (keep the new mini-card per practice design)

Do not revert to accordions.

For each phase card (Planning & Scoping, Context Management, Codegen Loop, Verification & Safeguards, Iteration Style, Deployment & Delivery):

Show a short phase summary.

At the top of the phase, show AI tools used in this phase as pills (e.g., for Palmer’s Planning: Grok, Perplexity).

Inside the phase: sub-cards for each practice/rule.

Collapsed view: practice title + small blurb.

Expanded view: Explanation (clear paragraph), Quote (verbatim, subtle blockquote style), Artifacts (tags / code / links).

Optional “Show more” if there are many sub-cards.

Evidence drawer per phase is fine to keep.

4) New page: How it Works (/how-it-works)

Explain Flowdex in a way that’s easy to scan and trustworthy. No backend needed; use placeholders. Sections:

What Flowdex Is
