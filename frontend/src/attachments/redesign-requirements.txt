We already have a builder workflow page, but it feels like stacked text and is hard to scan. Redesign for desktop-first showcase quality. Do not change routes or add backend; mock data where needed.

0) Global polish (all pages)

Remove any blur overlays and heavy gradients. Use a clean, modern SaaS look.

Sticky top app bar with brand Flowdex (click → /) and right-side links:

Builders → / (library)

How it Works → /how-it-works

Add Builder (opens modal; see spec below)

1) Builder workflow page /builders/[builderId]

Goal: a sharp, enjoyable page that’s fast to scan but rich on expand.

A. Top sticky phase nav (desktop-first)

A slim bar pinned below the app header with phase anchors. Items (in this exact order):

Planning & Scoping

Context Management

Codegen Loop

Verification & Safeguards

Iteration Style

Deployment & Delivery

Clicking a tab scrolls smoothly to the section. Scrollspy must highlight the active tab while scrolling.

B. Phase groups (cards)

Each phase is a distinct card group with:

Title + 1-line description.

Tools used in this phase (pills), aligned to the right of the header.

Provide Expand all / Collapse all for the phase’s sub-cards.

C. Sub-cards (practices / rules / methods)

Each item is a compact card with:

Small colored pill (Rule / Practice / Method) + Title.

Explanation (primary): show 1–2 lines by default; expand for the full text. Slightly larger type + darker color than quotes.

Quotes (secondary): small, muted, italic blockquote style with timestamp; show max 2 rows by default; “Show more quotes (N)” expands.

Artifacts (tertiary): collapsed by default; on expand, show dark code panel or file/link tiles (monospace for code).

Tools applied (if specific to the sub-card): tiny pills at card footer.

Subtle dividers and tighter vertical rhythm — no tall, padded blocks.

D. Sections that must ALWAYS render

The following phases are required; do not omit even if content is mocked:

Planning & Scoping

Context Management

Codegen Loop

Verification & Safeguards (its own phase — do not merge elsewhere)
