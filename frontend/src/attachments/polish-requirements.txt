Title

Flowdex — Polish the Builder page: explanation-first, compact quotes, calmer density

Prompt

Do not redesign. Apply these targeted polish changes to the existing Builder page:

1) Sub-card anatomy (each practice/rule card)

Order & emphasis

Title row (type badge + label + “Collapse/Expand” action).

Explanation — primary content. Render as short bulleted points (2–4 bullets) instead of a paragraph when possible; otherwise a compact paragraph. Keep line length comfortable.

Quotes — secondary. Render as compact list items (one line each) with truncated text and timestamp; expand to full quote on click.

Artifacts — collapsed by default behind “Show artifacts (N)”.

Explanation style

Make it visually dominant: slightly larger than quotes; medium weight.

Add a tiny label “Explanation” but keep it subtle.

Quotes style (compact)

Each quote is a small row: “❝ text… ❞ • 00:02:15 [Copy] [▶]”

Muted color, no large block backgrounds. On expand, show full text in a light blockquote.

Max 2 quotes visible; add “Show more quotes (N)” to reveal the rest.

Spacing

Reduce vertical padding inside the card; use tighter gaps between sections.

Keep clear dividers between Explanation / Quotes / Artifacts.

2) Phase card header

Keep the short sentence under the phase title.

Tools used in this phase stay on the right, but visually smaller (secondary). Use subtle chips.

Add an optional “Expand all / Collapse all” for the practices grid within this phase.

3) Density & hierarchy

Reduce heading weight where it feels shouty; use one strong heading per card (phase title).

Prefer sm/base body sizes with good contrast; let white space do the work, not big borders.

Ensure icons/actions (Copy/Play/Collapse) are right-aligned and consistent.

4) Empty/missing states

If a practice has no quotes or artifacts, show unobtrusive inline notes: “No quotes captured.” / “No artifacts.”

5) Accessibility

Quote rows are buttons with proper labels; Enter/Space toggles expand.

“Expand all” is keyboard accessible.

Acceptance criteria

In a practice card, your eye lands on the Explanation first; quotes are clearly secondary and compact.

Two or fewer lines of quote text visible by default; deep content is behind “Show more”.

Artifacts are collapsed by default.

Overall card height is shorter than before for the same content.
