    ⏺ Session Summary

  What We've Built

  Goal: Create AI-powered workflow extraction from interview transcripts using Pydantic AI + Gemini 2.5 Pro

  Files Created:
  1. backend/src/backend_app/models/workflow_extraction_models.py - Data structures (WorkflowCard, WorkflowPhase, WorkflowExtraction)
  2. backend/src/backend_app/services/pydantic_workflow_extractor.py - Pydantic AI agent using Gemini 2.5 Pro for semantic extraction
  3. backend/src/backend_app/services/workflow_extraction_orchestrator.py - Pipeline orchestrator (read → extract → return)
  4. backend/tests/services/test_markdown_formatter.py - Markdown formatter for test output examination
  5. backend/tests/services/test_workflow_extraction_pipeline.py - Test script to run full pipeline

  Dependencies Added: pydantic-ai>=0.7.4

  Current State

  - Working: All core services built, Gemini API integration configured
  - Issue: Async test execution (anyio plugin not working correctly)
  - Ready: Pipeline should extract Palmer's workflow from backend/tests/downloads/assembyly_ai_transcript.txt into structured 6-phase format

  Next Session Goals

  1. Fix async test execution - Get the pipeline running
  2. Generate workflow_extraction.txt - Test AI extraction quality
  3. Review output - Compare against backend/_docs/workflow_example_palmer.md format
  4. Iterate on prompts if extraction quality needs improvement

  Key Files to Review Next Session

  - backend/_docs/python-rules.md - Backend coding standards
  - backend/_docs/workflow_example_palmer.md - Target output format
  - backend/tests/HOW-TO-RUN-TESTS.md - Test execution guide
  - backend/tests/downloads/assembyly_ai_transcript.txt - Source transcript
  - All 5 files we created above

  Environment: Uses GEMINI_API_KEY, follows your Python rules (uv, dataclasses, ≤500 lines, clear docstrings)

> no explain the goal conceptually with a project mind as well not just code jargon

⏺ Project Summary: AI Workflow Showcase

  The Big Picture

  You're building Gauntlet AI - a platform that analyzes how top engineers work with AI tools. Think of it as "studying the best players' game film" but for
  AI-first software development.

  What We're Solving

  Problem: Everyone uses AI differently for coding, but there's no way to compare and learn from the best workflows. Palmer has an amazing system, but it's
  trapped in a 1-hour interview.

  Solution: Extract structured, comparable "workflow cards" from interview transcripts so people can see exactly how experts like Palmer approach each phase of
   development.

  The 6 Workflow Phases We Extract

  1. Planning & Scoping - How they start projects, set constraints
  2. Context Management - How they organize info for AI models
  3. Codegen Loop - How they guide AI to write code
  4. Verification & Safeguards - How they catch mistakes
  5. Iteration Style - How they evolve and improve solutions
  6. Deployment & Delivery - How they ship to users

  Current State

  We've built the backend extraction engine that takes Palmer's interview transcript and uses Pydantic AI + Gemini to intelligently extract his workflow
  practices into structured cards (just like the manual Palmer example you showed me).

  Next: Test & Refine

  Run the extraction, examine the quality, and iterate until we get Palmer-quality structured output that you can feed into your frontend for users to browse
  and compare workflows.

  End Goal: Anyone can upload an interview, get structured workflow cards, and learn from the best AI-first engineers.
