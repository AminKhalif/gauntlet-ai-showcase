Chat Summary: Frontend Analysis & AI-First Rules

  What We Accomplished

  Analyzed your frontend codebase:
  - Next.js 15 + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + Tailwind
  - Well-organized structure: app/ (routes), components/ (UI), hooks/, lib/
  - Currently uses mock data from components/workflow/data.ts
  - Some tight coupling issues but generally clean architecture

  Created AI-first ruleset files in frontend/_agent_docs/:
  - theme-ui-rules.md - Zinc-based styling guidelines to prevent random colors
  - code-rules.md - TypeScript/React rules with GPT-5 feedback, AI-compatible patterns
  - user-flow.md - Navigation and interaction patterns

  Key rules prevent your previous problems:
  - Files under 500 lines, proper TypeScript types
  - Consistent zinc color system (text-zinc-900, bg-white, etc.)
  - Server Components by default, proper file naming (useThing.ts)
  - Quality gates: npm run lint, npm run typecheck must pass

  Current Task: Connect Backend + Frontend

  Problem: Backend and frontend are completely siloed. Add Builder modal doesn't work end-to-end.

  Goal: Full workflow from Add Builder → Display Builder Profile
  1. User submits Add Builder modal (name + YouTube URL)
  2. Store builder in database
  3. Trigger your diarization pipeline
  4. Render formatted content from your LangExtract Pydantic models
  5. Builder profile displays nicely on /builders/[slug] page

  Architecture Questions:
  - Should YouTube MP3 be downloaded to GCS bucket with Supabase storing the URL?
  - Start with API routes first?
  - How to structure the data flow between your existing backend services and frontend?

  Your Backend Services Ready:
  - YouTube downloader
  - Audio chunking + transcription (Gemini)
  - AssemblyAI diarization
  - LangExtract workflow extraction
  - Supabase + GCS storage

  Current Frontend:
  - Add Builder modal (form validation working)
  - Builder display pages (using mock data)
  - Clean component structure ready for real data

  Next Steps to Consider:
  - Create Next.js API routes to interface with your Python backend
  - Design data flow: Frontend → API → Python services → Database → Frontend
  - Decide on async processing (how long does full pipeline take?)
  - Update frontend components to consume real API data instead of mock data

  Incremental Steps (My Professional Recommendation)

  Step 1: Database + Mock API (1-2 days)
  Build: Supabase schema + Next.js API routes
  Test: Modal creates builder record, shows "processing" page
  Risk: Low - no external APIs

  Step 2: Static Builder Pages (1 day)
  Build: Builder profile pages with fake workflow data
  Test: Full user flow works (create → processing → profile)
  Risk: Low - just UI work

  Step 3: One Real Service Integration (1 day)
  Build: JUST YouTube downloader → GCS storage
  Test: Can download 1 video, store metadata in Supabase
  Risk: Medium - first real API integration

  Step 4: Add Processing Pipeline (2-3 days)
  Build: Connect existing transcription/extraction services
  Test: Full pipeline with 1 test video
  Risk: High - multiple moving parts
