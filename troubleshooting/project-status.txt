You were working with Claude to optimize an audio transcription task. The goal was to transcribe a 59-minute podcast as quickly as possible using the Gemini API.

Here's what you did:

Initial Test: You started by using 10 concurrent workers to process 8 audio chunks. This failed immediately due to "Empty response" errors, which you concluded were caused by hitting the Gemini API's rate limits.

Second Test (7 Workers): You then tried to use 7 workers, but this also failed for the same reason.

Successful Test (5 Workers): A test with 5 workers was successful, but it took 7.2 minutes to complete.

Next Steps: You and Claude then discussed ways to further optimize the process. The main ideas were:

Using smaller chunks: You considered splitting the audio into smaller chunks (e.g., 4-minute chunks instead of 8-minute chunks).

Switching models: You discussed switching from gemini-2.5-pro to the potentially faster gemini-2.5-flash model.

You were about to ask Claude to research the trade-offs between these two options when the conversation was interrupted.
